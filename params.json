  "body": "# AsgredLists\r\nThis tool automatically generates all the lists and generates and executes pyraf scripts for spectra reduction using asgred package for IRAF.\r\nIt is capable of listing images' properties, read from imhead, generating all the lists needed in all the steps of the reduction, generate one or multiple PyRAF scripts and executing them, auto-resolve conflicts and errors, auto-recognize standard stars.\r\n\r\nThe latter is valid only for standard stars included in the Asiago Astrophisical Observatory list (http://www.astro.unipd.it/~t120/stanlis.htm), for this tool is explicitly thought to be used on images taken from this observatory.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this tool is NOT to substitute the operator but just to relieve him/her from any work that can be done just as good from a computer.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it still is care of the operator to make the wavelenght mask for lamps and the actual spectrum extraction, done using the apall task.\r\n\r\n# Pre-requirements\r\nAsgredLists requires:\r\n * IRAF;\r\n * PyRAF;\r\n * asgred;\r\n * python (>=3.0);\r\n * xdotool;\r\n * JDK (>=1.8).\r\n\r\n### Pre-requirements installation for Ubuntu/Debian\r\nTo install the JDK we will add the <a href=\"http://ppa.webupd8.org/\">WebUpd8</a> PPA repository: it contains the compiled version of JAVA ready to be installed.\r\n##### How to install JDK for Debian\r\nIn Debian systems, run the following commands in your terminal:\r\n```sh\r\nsu -\r\necho \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main\" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list\r\necho \"deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main\" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list\r\napt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys EEA14886\r\napt-get update\r\napt-get install oracle-java8-installer\r\nexit\r\n```\r\n##### How to install JDK for Ubuntu\r\nIn Ubuntu systems, run the following commands in your terminal:\r\n```sh\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\r\n```\r\n##### How to install python and xdotool\r\nNow install python and xdotool using the following command:\r\n```sh\r\nsudo apt-get install python3 xdotool\r\n```\r\n##### How to install IRAF and PyRAF\r\nDownload <a href=\"http://www.astro.uson.mx/favilac/downloads/ubuntu-iraf/iso/\">this image</a> containing both IRAF and PyRAF.\r\nThen mount it and install it.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nNo installation is needed: you can either download the executable jar file in the release section (https://github.com/gogolander/AsgredLists/releases) or download the source code and compile it.\r\n##### Download sources via git\r\nThe best way to download the sources is via the git tool. Install it with the following command:\r\n```sh\r\nsudo apt-get install git\r\n```\r\nand download the repository using this command:\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/gogolander/AsgredLists.git\r\n```\r\n##### Compilation\r\nIn order to compile AsgredLists you need the Maven compilator. Get it with the following command:\r\n```sh\r\nsudo apt-get install maven\r\n```\r\nThen open a terminal in the source folder and run the following command to launch the compilation:\r\n```sh\r\nmvn clean license:format install prepare-package package\r\n```\r\nIf the compilation ends successfully, you will find the executable file ```AsgredLists.jar``` in the subfolder\r\n```\r\nAsgredLists/target\r\n```\r\n##### Warning\r\nWhen started, the Maven compilation needs to download more than 10Mb of required JAR libraries. Keep it in mind if you are using a metered connection.\r\n\r\n# Execution\r\n![Image of Launch with Java Runtime](https://github.com/gogolander/AsgredLists/wiki/images/default_application.png)\r\nYou have two choises:\r\n * use the command ```java -jar asgredLists.jar```\r\n * since the JAR file is an executable file, you can grant execution priviledge to it with the command ```chmod +x asgredLists.jar``` and associate it with the Java Runtime Machine in this way:\r\n  1. right-click on the JAR, open ```Properties``` and the go to the ```Open with``` tab;\r\n  2. scroll the list until you find ```Oracle Java 8 Runtime```: select it and then click on ```Set as default```\r\n  3. now you can run asgredLists just double-clicking it.\r\n  \r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nFor a full documentation about AsgredLists, how it works, how it is done, please read our wiki-page: https://github.com/gogolander/AsgredLists/wiki\r\n \r\n",
